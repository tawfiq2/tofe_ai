# Echoes of the Desert

Prototype Swift package modelling a small slice of the "Echoes of the Desert" RPG concept.

The package contains a few domain types for regions, characters and the ancient seal
fragments. Running the executable demonstrates recovering fragments and reporting
progress toward rebuilding the seal.

This code is a placeholder for an eventual iOS project and focuses purely on
lightweight game logic that can compile in this environment.
